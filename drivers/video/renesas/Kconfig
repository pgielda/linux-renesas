	  Frame-buffer device for the Renesas RZ/A1H based boards.
	  This version of driver supports the following board and
	  LCD panels.
	  + the "Genmai" CPU board with Option board
	    + Channel 0:
	      (0) unuse
	      (1) LCD-KIT-B01 (using J10 connector)
	      (2) LCD Moniror (using J15 connector)
	    + Channel 1:
	      (0) unuse
	      (1) LCD-KIT-B01 (using J12 connector)
	      (2) R0P7724LE0011RL (using J14 connector)
	      (3) LCD Moniror (using J16 connector)
	  To choose the LCD panel, use vdc5fb0= kernel boot option
	  for channel 0 and vdc5fb1= for channel 1, like:
	      vdc5fb0=1 vdc5fb1=0
	  This example shows that the LCD-KIT-B01 is used for
	  channel 0, and channel 1 is not used. Please use this
	  driver with this default configuration.
	  Note that there are some signal line conflictions
	  between channel 1 of this device and SDHI/ETHER devices.
	  So, when you specify other than 0 with vdc5fb1= option,
	  this driver forcibly disables the SDHI/ETHER drivers.
	  You also need to change jumper and dip-switch settings.
